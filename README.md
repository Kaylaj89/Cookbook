## About Family Heirloom

Family Heirloom is a web application that allows families to stay connected to their past, present, and future through the sharing of family recipes. 

Family heirloom users can:

- Register a 'team' with Family Heirloom (FH) so that family can add recipes to a shared repository
- Upload photos of hand-written recipes
- Transcribe recipes into a beautifully formatted form
- Share transcription duties with other family members
- Create author/biography pages for recipe authors
- Comment on recipes, noting any changes you may have made while cooking the recipe
- Order ingredients from a recipe straight off of Amazon Fresh.
